    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
    <h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a></h3>
    <p>w3schools is an educational site that covers a host of programming languages, spanning from HTML and CSS to C and
        C++. The website contains tutorials as well as references for each language.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> w3schools uses contrast well to distinguish the parts of the page. Text is easily
            readable because its color contrasts strongly with its background, whether that is dark or light. In
            addition, the currently selected tabs
            on the top and side navbars are green to show the user's current position. Buttons are also easily
            distinguished by their green color.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The site is very uniform throughout. Every page including the home page has the
            same header, and all articles have the same text style, spacing, and button placement. The table of contents
            for each language is structured similarly as well. The only way the site has poor repetition is that the
            "sign up" button is an oval, whereas every other button on the website is a rounded rectangle.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> w3schools has very simple alignment that is very readable. Articles have the
            content, headers, and buttons all left justified, which is very natural for the reader. The header and table
            of contents sidebar both have all of their child objects aligned neatly.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Proximity is arguably w3schools' weakest CRAP category. The site feels very
            crowded because all of the items in menus and tables of contents are packed very tightly. This allows for a
            lot of content to be fit, and everything is organized well enough where it is readable, but the pages still
            feel mildly claustrophobic and busy.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a href="https://www.theblondeabroad.com/">The Blonde Abroad</a></h3>
    <p>The Blonde Abroad is a travel blog run by a girl named Kiersten. I don't know much about it, I just found it
        while googling and noted that it could be improved by better applying the CRAP principles.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The Blonde Abroad blog could use better contrast. Accent text on the site is a
            shade of tan only slightly darker than the background color, making it hard to read. In addition, text that
            is dark is a very light font weight, meaning it contrasts poorly from its background. The site does alright
            at distinguishing different article previews with colors different from the white background, but they don't
            contrast strongly enough. In addition, the menu bar at the top is white, which means it is easy to miss
            given a white background. Articles are much easier to read, as they have a heavier font on a white
            background.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> This blog is reasonably consistent throughout. Article previews on the home
            page have a consistent design, and the same 2/3 fonts are used throughout, the fanciest of which is only
            used for accents. Colors are very consistent, and articles have a consistent structure.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Alignment is by far the weak point of this website. The title of the blog
            overlaps text on the homepage and in articles. In addition, on the homepage article previews are seemingly
            randomly justified right and left. Once you get into the articles, alignment improves significantly, as text
            and images uniformly span the width of the page. It seems that this blog was designed for a mobile device
            with desktop/tablets not taken into account at all. Given the target audience, this could be a very
            reasonable choice.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Proximity is done well on this site if you ignore the problems caused by
            alignment designed for mobile devices. Any block/item on the page has text spaced well so that separations
            are visible but not excessive, and uniform. Spacing in articles is well done aside from the fact that left
            and right margins for text are nonexistent, which means text goes right up to the edge of the screen.
        </li>
    </ul>
