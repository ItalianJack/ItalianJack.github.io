        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Military brat, born in Italy, and moved all over the
                eastern/midwestern US before
                settling in Charlotte in 2012. Curious about pretty much everything, but I spend my time doing some
                light gaming, working on my home server, flying airplanes and shooting (as finances allow), and
                tinkering with everything from my car to radios to 3d printing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> Coached NASP archery team and classes for middle & high
                schoolers for 2 years.
                Taught a few classes for my homeschool co-op, too. Worked an internship doing IT for an engineering firm
                summer of 2023.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Academic Background:</strong> Proud homeschooler and graduate of South Piedmont Community
                College with an
                Associate in Science. EMT trained, and also made it to National Finals for the CyberPatriot
                cybersecurity defense competition back in high school. Private Pilot as of May of this year.

            <li>
                <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows is spyware trash, Pop_OS!/Ubuntu Linux all the way.
                Living with an
                operating system that no one has heard of only occasionally makes me want to break things.

                grandpa has too.
            </li>
            <li><strong>I’d Also Like to Share:</strong> “Consider the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor
                spin, yet I tell you,
                even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass, which
                is alive in the field today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O
                you of little faith!” <em>– Luke 12:27-28</em>
            </li>
